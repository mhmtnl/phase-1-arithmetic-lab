let num1 = 31; let num2 = 2; 
let multiply = num1 * num2; 
// Create a variable called multiply set to an equation that will multiply the variables num1 and num2; the result of the multiplication should be 62.

let random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10)
// Create a variable called random that will generate a random integer greater than 0.

let num3 =16 
let num4 =12
let mod = num3 % num4 
// Create a variable called mod set to an equation that will calculate the remainder of dividing variable num3 by num4; the remainder should be 4.

let max = Math.max(5,20)
// Create a variable called max that finds the highest number in a set; the value returned should be 20.
